## Introduction

EasyType is a cutting-edge, responsive web application that draws inspiration from the renowned open-source MonkeyType platform. Designed with an educational intent, it offers a rich environment for users keen on enhancing their typing skills. This app supports a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers, to ensure a flawless user experience. It features a dedicated server architecture for managing user accounts, allowing for customized typing practice with in-depth feedback on metrics such as speed, accuracy, and more after each session.

The inception of this app was as a frontend-centric project, developed personally by me. Although initially inspired by MonkeyType, EasyType has evolved significantly. To see the beginnings of this journey, you can explore the initial frontend development repository here: [\[Frontend\]](https://github.com/miguelrodriguezp99/typing-web-frontend).

- **Multiple Themes and Sounds:** Personalize your practice environment by selecting from a variety of themes to change the appâ€™s color scheme and toggling keyboard sounds according to your preference.

## What's New

EasyType is profoundly inspired by MonkeyType, a pillar in the typing practice community. However, unlike the original MonkeyType, which is built on vanilla JavaScript, EasyType is fully developed in React. This foundational difference has allowed for the replication of MonkeyType's functionality within EasyType through a completely distinct codebase, with a focus on learning and improvement. This approach not only mirrors the real-time typing test dynamics but also introduces an array of custom features and optimizations inherent to the React ecosystem, distinguishing EasyType in its right while paying homage to the open-source project that inspired it.
